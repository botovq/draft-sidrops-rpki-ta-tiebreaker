    <abstract>
      <t>
	A Trust Anchor (TA) in the RPKI is represented by a self-signed X.509 Certification Authority (CA) certificate.
        It is possible for Relying Parties (RP) to have acquired multiple different issuances of valid TA certificates from the same TA operator.
        This document proposes a tiebreaking scheme to be used by RPs to select one TA certificate for certification path validation.
        This document updates RFC 8630.

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>
        In the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) hierarchical structure, a Trust Anchor is an authority for which trust is assumed and not derived.
        TA operators periodically reissue TA certificates to introduce changes to, for example, modify the set of IP Address Delegations and/or Autonomous System Identifier Delegations included in the <xref target="RFC3779"/> extension(s), the content of the Subject Information Access extension (<xref target="RFC5280" section="4.2.2.2"/>), and the certificate validity period (<xref target="RFC5280" section="4.1.2.5"/>).
      </t>
      <t>
        Relying Parties periodically download purported current Trust Anchor certificates from remote locations and verify that the key of the self-signed certificate matches the key embedded in its associated Trust Anchor Locator <xref target="RFC8630"/>.
        This means that Relying Parties have a choice between using a previously retrieved locally cached copy of the TA certificate and the newly-retrieved instance of the TA certificate.
      </t>
      <t>
        In the past some Trust Anchor certificates were issued with egregious validity periods, in some cases up to a century.
        Trust Anchor operators cannot revoke previously issued instances of TA certificates.
        This means that an on-path adversary or caching network elements could present Relying Parties with an older instance of the TA certificate than the TA operator intended for Relying Parties to use.
        This document proposes a tiebreaking scheme for Relying Parties to prefer the 'more recently' issued instance of the TA certificate using the notBefore date as an indicator and as second tiebreaker to prefer TA certificates with a shorter validity window.
